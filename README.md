# Midcentroids

Code for the Midcentroids collection https://opensea.io/collection/midcentroids

Inspired by midcentury lines and color palettes, Midcentroids are algorithmically 
defined polygons built from a random walk parameterized by a unique random seed. 
Catmull-Rom splines and a variety of closure methods give each Midcentroid a 
classic form. Limited to 101 pieces (mint 0 reserved by artist), this series 
explores a broad range of algorithmic space without curation.

# Properties

- Straight Lines - restrict random walk to one direction at a time
- Grid Pattern - arrange Midcentroids in a grid instead
- Outlined - outline each Midcentroid
- Hot Outline - if outlined, used a contrasting outline color
- Closure Mode - close Midcentroids by cutting to origin, randomly walking to origin, retracing steps, or mirroring across the center
- Emblem Size, Count - Midcentroid size and count
- Emblem Complexity - how many points to use for each Midcentroid
- Palette - the colors to use
- Palette Depth - how deeply to sample the palette. "High" may have contrast colors
